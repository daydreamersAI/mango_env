The main idea of this project is to use the power of gpt-4/image models as an observation to control the computer and be able to assist us in firstly simple tasks like opening certain apps and adding notes etc.

Features :
two types of envs are together :
1) Simple rl env based on the pyautogui module
2) Selenium based rl env that could take web actions - coming soon (positively on christmas eve)

Below is some set of example actions being executed using this env which have been fed manually
Try out your set of actions and have fun... :]

Todo:
1) Add selenium env
2) make a module once the agent is working
3) release the agent named mango bot on this env

The examples of the environment workings are below :

1)Pure RL environment with different tool use in paint:
